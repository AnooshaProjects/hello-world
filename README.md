# hello-world
Just starting my GitHub account, to use git version control. I hope to create many personal projects, going ahead.

Hello,
So this "readme-edits" is the first branch, of the master, of the hello-world repository.
My name's Anoosha. I've been working as Software Engineer with Java, SQL, and Unix Shell Scripts. 
Hope to try out interesting projects here. I like singing, dancing, poetry and literature. I'm interested in various things, like, Web, Android, Embedded Systems, Electronics, etc.
