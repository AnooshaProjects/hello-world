# hello-world
Welcome to my GitHub account. I hope to create many personal projects, going ahead.

Hello,
So this "readme-edits" is the first branch, of the master, of the hello-world repository.
My name's Anoosha. I've been working as a Software Engineer using Java, SQL, and Linux Shell Scripts. 
Hope to try out interesting projects here. I'm interested in various areas, like, Microservices, Cloud, Azure, Web Services, REST APIs, Kafka, Android apps programming, Embedded Systems, VHDL, Electronics, etc.
